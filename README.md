# Prolog Family Tree Reasoner â€” CS152 Final Project

This project implements a logic-based family tree reasoner using **Prolog** as part of the CS152 course on Artificial Intelligence at Minerva University.

It models family relationships like siblings, cousins, ancestors, and allows inference-based queries â€” applying key course learning outcomes:  
- `#cs152-ailogic`  
- `#cs152-aicoding`

## ðŸ”§ Features
- âœ… Define parent, male/female relationships
- âœ… Infer siblings, grandparents, aunts/uncles
- âœ… Compute recursive ancestors
- âœ… Advanced: maternal/paternal cousins
- âœ… Track number of inference steps for queries

## â–¶ How to Run in [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/)
1. Paste `family_tree.pl` into [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/)
2. Run queries like:
```prolog
?- cousin(alice, Who).
?- ancestor(michael, emma).
?- trackable_ancestor(michael, emma).
